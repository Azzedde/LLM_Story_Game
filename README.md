### LLM Story Game

This interactive game challenges you to survive by keeping your HP above 0. You'll use mana to select the right actions, while the outcome of future events is influenced by your luck. Each event is visually represented by images generated using the Flux [dev] model with warm inference via Hugging Face.

To start playing, simply provide your OpenAI GPT API key and HuggingFace token in an `.env` file, as the game performs best when integrated with GPT models.

#### Features:
- **HP, Mana, and Luck system**: Manage your resources carefully to survive.
- **Dynamic event images**: Flux [dev] generates event images in real-time.
- **Luck-driven events**: Unpredictable outcomes based on your luck.
